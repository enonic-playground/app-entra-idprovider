What's new in version 3 

- Starting from version 3.0, it is possible to specify `oidcWellKnownEndpoint` (Provider's OpenID Connect Discovery URL) to obtain the values for the `issuer`,`authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`,  `userinfo_endpoint` and `jwks_uri`  properties.
- User `displayName` and `email` are now automatically updated when the user logs in with Authorization Code Flow.
- Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is now supported and used by default. Disable it (`usePkce = false`) if your provider does not support it.
- In Authorization Code Flow, the ID Token verification is now done with the public keys from the JWKS URI (`jwksUri`).
- The `clientId` and `clientSecret` fields are now optional in the ID Provider configuration. If you want to disable Authorization Code Flow, `clientId` should be omitted.
